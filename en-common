If the broker holding the leader for the partition fails to serve the data due to any failure, one of its respective ISR replicas will takeover the leadership. 
Afterward, if the previous leader returns back, it tries to acquire its leadership again.

If the value of key=NULL, it means that the data is sent without a key. Thus, it will be distributed in a round-robin manner (i.e., distributed to each partition).

If the value of the key!=NULL, it means the key is attached with the data, and thus all messages will always be delivered to the same partition.

If you don't have ``sudo`` permissions or want to install the AWS CLI v2 only for the current user, run the `install` script with the `-b` and `-i` options
